# Word-Counter
Your program should be called wordCount. It should accept the text file from standard input. The output must obey the following specifications. Output both lists to standard output, with a single blank line between the lists, and no other information (such as headings). Each line holds a single word and its count, separated by a single space.

You must use a hash table to store the counts. You may use any hash function and any collision-resolution scheme you wish.

You must write your own sorting algorithm to sort the output and your own hash-table routines. (You may not use any library routines for sorting or hashing.) You will lose 2 points if you use selection sort or insertion sort; you will get full credit for heapsort, merge sort, or quicksort. You may not use any other sorting method.
